      	<h1>User Behavior and Ad Click Predicton</h1>
      	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Digital Advertising is a multi-billionaire industry that is forecasted to grow globally from $135 billion in 2014 to $240 billion in 2019. As businesses such as e-commerce websites, ad display networks as well as big names such as Google and Facebook rely heavily on ads as a source of income, the ability to predict which ad a user will click is pivotal in ensuring advertising success and highest return on investment. By understanding patterns in user behavior, advertisers can provide more relevant content to maximize ad CTR and improve the user experience. In this project, I explore factors that contribute to a user’s likelihood of clicking on an ad and build a supervised learning algorithm designed to predict which ad a user is likely to click on. </p>

		<h2>Data Description</h2>
		<p>Avito, Russia’s largest general classified website allows sellers to place ads on their site for a wide variety of items from electrionics to cars to dogs and cats. Avito has over 31 million active listings in 2015. Although Avito provides a great wealth of goods and services for it's 70 million unique monthly visitors, the task of deciding which ads to show for each individual users is difficult. At the time, Avito used only general statistics on ad performance, not taking into account user behavior, making it difficult to provide relevant ads to its users. A result, Avito has provided a dataset that contains 300 million randomly sampled users searches from two months. Each row represents an ad that is shown to the user based on a search. The ads listed on Avito’s website consists of three types: regular free ads posted from users, paid ads which are highlighted and placed at the top of the page for a certain time and contextual ads in which the owner pays per visitor click. The goal is to discover insights on user behavior related to ad clicks as well as build a learning algorthm that will predict whether a user will click on a given ad.  For each record the following characteristics are available:</p>

		<h2>Data Prep/Cleaning</h2>
		<p>The dataset only contains click labels for contextual ads. Since I am interested in factors that drive ad clicks I drop all rows containing non contextual ads. Additionally, the data is about 11gb in size so a smaller subset of the first 500,000 records is used for the initial analysis due to memory constraints as well as computation time. </p>
		<h2>Overall Website Activity</h2>
		<p>To begin, I was interested in seeing how the website was performing overall. When were clicks occuring most frequently and when was click activity the lowest?</p>
		
		<div id="chart"></div>
		<script src="js/clicks_heatmap.js"></script>

    	<p>We can see that the website has the lowest number of clicks from 1AM to 8AM. The number of total clicks start to pick up from 8AM to 9AM. With this information we have a better understanding about the optimal times and days to place ads.</p>

    	<h2>Search Users vs. Filter Users</h2>	
    	<p>Now that we have a general idea about when clicks are occuring we can go one layer deeper to find out what factors are driving these clicks. I was particularly interested in the question: how does ad click performance differ from users who enter a search query versus users who just click the filter by category option?</p>

    	<div id="chart2area"></div>
		<script src="pie.js"></script>
		<script src="ad_click_rates.js"></script>

		<p>Wow, only 18% of users enter a search query. What's really interesting is that search users are more than two times more likely to click on an ad compared to users who only click on the filter option or those who don't search or filter at all!  </p>
